#  Challenge_20

For this challenge assignment I am working as a new hire at a fintech startup company. The company is building smart contracts to automate many of the firms processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. Inorder to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I need to create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
